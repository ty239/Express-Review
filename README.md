# ⚛️ React Mini!

This is meant to get you started learning React! It uses Webpack and Babel to complile your React code, along with your CSS. You can also use `webpack-dev-server` to preview your React application locally, and the application will rebuild quickly on every file save. By default, the server runs on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone or fork this repository on GitHub.
2. Install the NPM packages: `npm install`
3. Preview your React app: `npm run start-dev`

If you're curious to see what Webpack is actually sending to the browser, try building the app with `npm start`. Then, look at `public/main.js`. What you find may shock and horrify you. 😱
